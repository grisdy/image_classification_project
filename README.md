Goals of this project to classify 6 categories:

In this experimet we are using 3 kind of model which is:
  - Mobilenet-V2
  - EfficientNet-B0
  - EfficientNet-B7

You can also play around with my model and try to classify an image using [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/)

You need to create an Streamlit account and then paste my GitHub URL :simple_smile:
